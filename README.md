# @moonlorian/vesting-dapp

This is the source code of a **Vesting dApp**, built on MultiversX blockchain.

It is composed by an Smart Contract + a website with 2 pages: administrator dashboard + user dashboard.

## Usage

### Smart Contract

Deploy a new smart contract for each token to apply vesting (see [sc](https://github.com/Moonlorian/vesting-dapp/tree/main/sc)).

- It will keep safely all the tokens to be distributed during the vesting period.

- It will store all the wallets and its vesting periods for each category.
 
### dApp

Setup the SC and deploy the dApp (see [dapp](https://github.com/Moonlorian/vesting-dapp/tree/main/dapp)).
